# Know It All: A two-player trivia game

## How the game works

1. Both players can enter their names (this step is optional, player names are saved as Player 1 and Player 2 by default). 
2. 10 questions are shown on the screen and each player gets 5 alternating turns.
3. Scores are tracked on-screen and after the final question the winner (or a draw) is announced.
 
### *Areas I'm working on*

- Allow for "play again" functionality. ✅
- Allow for single-player functionality. ✍️
- Allow player(s) to choose categories before answering questions. ✍️
- Make sure each player is answering questions of equal difficulty. ✍️
- Increase the difficulty of the questions over the course of the game. ✍️
